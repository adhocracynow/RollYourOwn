# RollYourOwn

Imagine you spent most of your engineering career honing your skills in a CAD application.  This is a tool you know inside and out.  But you are limited.  Limited by the tool.  Limited by the licenses that are available to you.  Limited by the technology and paradigms the tool was developed for, the aging hardware the tool was developed for.

Despite these limits, you are able to do some amazing things with this tool and have created a lot of value for you, your team, your plant and your company.

All the while there is a thread just out of reach.  If only you had a little more control, a little more access to the underlying kernel, a little more performance so those complicated models don't take minutes to open, minutes to update, weeks to build, days to revise.  You begin to compile a list of things you wish you could do.  You know MUST be possible.  Things that would take the value you are creating to another level.  But you have reached the ceiling of what is practical, maybe what is possible at all.  The tool can do no more.

Now imagine if you could pull that thread.  Find a tool that can do many of those things you've always wished you could do.  A tool that isn't limited by what its creators deemed valuable.  A tool that isn't limited by old technology, old paradigms.  A tool that doesn't require licenses.  A tool that is no longer limited by hardware, but instead enabled by it; leveraging the amazing GPU technology that is available today.  A tool that is only limited by your imagination. That and the number of hours you are awake.  You are the creator, this is your tool.

Even more importantly, this is a tool your competitors do not have.  Because they have not pulled that thread.  At least not yet.

Roll your own.  This is the way.
